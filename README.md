# FlashCards

## Overview

---
FlashCards is a simple terminal based game where the player is shown a series of questions, and is prompted to respond to them in turn. The player selects an answer to the question with a) the up and down arrow keys (and enter to confirm) or b) manually entering a number (between 1 & 3) and using enter to confirm. The game will continue untill all questions have been answered, and the final score will be shown (with an extra treat if you score above 90%!!!)
